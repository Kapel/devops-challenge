# Bird Application

This is the bird Application! It gives us birds!!!

The app is written in Golang and contains 2 APIs:
- the bird API
- the birdImage API

When you run the application (figure it out), you will see the relationship between those 2 APIs.

# installation & how to run it

Everything can be found in [my-notes.md](./my-notes.md#initial-install)

# Challenge

tl;dr - everything is in [my-notes.md](./my-notes.md)
It's quite lengthy, but I've tried my best to share as much knowledge as I could

How to:
- fork the repository
- work on the challenges
- share your repository link with the recruitment team

Here are the challenges:
- [Install and run the app](./my-notes.md#initial-install)
- [Dockerize it (create dockerfile for each API)](./my-notes.md#dockerisation)
- [Create an infra on AWS (VPC, SG, instances) using IaC](./my-notes.md#create-an-infra-on-aws-vpc-sg-instances-using-iac)
- [Install a small version of kubernetes on the instances (no EKS)](./my-notes.md#install-a-small-version-of-kubernetes-on-the-instances-no-eks)
- [Build the manifests to run the 2 APIs on k8s](./my-notes.md#build-the-manifests-to-run-the-2-apis-on-k8s)
- Bonus points: [observability](./my-notes.md#observability), [helm](./my-notes.md#helm), [scaling](./my-notes.md#scaling)

Rules:
- Use security / container / k8s / cloud best practices
- Change in the source code is possible

Evaluation criterias:
- best practices
- code organization
- clarity & readability
